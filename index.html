        <h2>About Nature</h2>
        <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole.
            In
            this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life.
            Although
            humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or
            outright
            separate and even superior to nature.
